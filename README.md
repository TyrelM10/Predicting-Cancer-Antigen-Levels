### Predicting Cancer Antigen Levels.
---
1. **Data Preparation**: I carefully imported and prepared clinical data for analysis, ensuring its quality and consistency.
 
2. **Regression Modelling and Model Selection**: Using techniques like <mark>Least Squares, Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regression</mark>, I developed various linear regression models. By employing cross-validation methods, I determined the most effective model for predicting cancer antigen levels.
   
3. **Clinical Insights**: I pinpointed and explained the most significant clinical measures influencing cancer antigen levels. These findings offer valuable insights for future research and potential medical applications.
